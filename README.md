# IAQ Monitor

The intention of this repo is to document the creation of an Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) monitor using open source parts. To see a comparison of commercially available IAQ monitors, see the [IAQ Monitors](./IAQ%20Monitors.md) page. Can we make one that is cheaper / more feature complete?

## Design Requirements
- Required parameters to capture: `CO2`, `PM2.5`, `Temp`, `RH`, `VOC`. The only commercially available monitors that capture all these parameters are:
  - Awair Element (~$300)
  - uHoo (~$330)
  - CPS IAQPRO (~$530)
- Long term data capture & storage
- Configurable dashboards for data viewing

## Components
