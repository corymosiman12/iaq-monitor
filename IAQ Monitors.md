# Available IAQ Monitors
[Nate Adams](https://energysmartohio.com/indoor-air-quality/which-indoor-air-quality-monitors-are-best-and-why/) performed a comparison of IAQ monitors in 2016. There is a lot of good information in that article about considerations when purchasing IAQ monitors, including: data availability, software usability, software integrations, etc. As products mature (or die), features are removed or deprecated and the ever evolving list of of available products along with their features is difficult to keep track of. The intention of this document is to maintain a (relatively) up to date list of consumer grade IAQ monitors, their features, and opinions about them.

Able to get a granular breakdown of particulates across the range of PM0.1 to PM10: (PM0.1, PM0.3, PM0.5, PM1.0, PM2.5, PM5.0, PM10), which is pretty unique to this sensor. They have 2 other similar products (A1, I1) with slightly different feature sets.
